# __PLUGIN_NAME__ Server Plugin Starter

This scaffold was generated by `plugin-sdk`.

## What this is

- A minimal third-party **server plugin** starter.
- Registration/grant contract via `orbpro.thirdparty.v1` FlatBuffers.

## Quick start

1. Update `plugin-manifest.json` with real IDs and capabilities.
2. Implement registration + grant flow in `src/index.js`.
3. Add account policy checks before issuing grants.
4. Return explicit `status`, `keyVersion`, and expiry semantics in grants.
5. Run conformance from the SDK package:

```bash
npm --prefix /path/to/space-data-network/packages/plugin-sdk run test:conformance
```

## Wire contract

- Encode registration with `encodeThirdPartyServerPluginRegistration`
- Decode grants with `decodeThirdPartyServerPluginGrant`
- Reject non-zero status and expired grants.

## OrbPro packaging reminder

When this plugin is shipped in OrbPro release packaging, the distribution target
is a single encrypted artifact named:

- `orbpro-licensing-server.sdn.plugin`

The release `licensing-server/` directory should contain only that file.
