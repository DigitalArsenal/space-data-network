# __PLUGIN_NAME__ Server Plugin Starter

This scaffold was generated by `@spacedatanetwork/plugin-sdk`.

## What this is

- A minimal third-party **server plugin** starter.
- Registration/grant contract via `orbpro.thirdparty.v1` FlatBuffers.

## Quick start

1. Update `plugin-manifest.json` with real IDs and capabilities.
2. Implement registration + grant flow in `src/index.js`.
3. Add account policy checks before issuing grants.
4. Run conformance from the SDK package:

```bash
npm --prefix /path/to/space-data-network/packages/plugin-sdk run test:conformance
```

## Wire contract

- Encode registration with `encodeThirdPartyServerPluginRegistration`
- Decode grants with `decodeThirdPartyServerPluginGrant`
- Reject non-zero status and expired grants.
