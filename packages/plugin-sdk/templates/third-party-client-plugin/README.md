# __PLUGIN_NAME__ Client Plugin Starter

This scaffold was generated by `@spacedatanetwork/plugin-sdk`.

## What this is

- A minimal third-party **client plugin** starter.
- Contracted against OrbPro third-party schemas in `orbpro.thirdparty.v1`.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies in your project.
2. Update `plugin-manifest.json` with your real IDs and vendor metadata.
3. Implement `src/index.js` request-signing and broker transport logic.
4. Run conformance against generated fixtures from the SDK package:

```bash
npm --prefix /path/to/space-data-network/packages/plugin-sdk run test:conformance
```

## Wire contract

- Encode request with `encodeThirdPartyClientLicenseRequest`
- Decode response with `decodeThirdPartyClientLicenseResponse`
- Validate status + key version before decrypting plugin material.
